### Folder Descriptions

- **scenes/**: Store all `.tscn` files here, organized by functionality
  - Use descriptive names: `main_menu.tscn`, `gameplay_hud.tscn`
  - Keep subscenes in subfolders for complex scenes

- **scripts/economy/**: Game economy logic
  - Trading systems
  - Currency management
  - Resource calculations

- **scripts/travel/**: Map & caravan logistics
  - Locations, routes and world map data
  - Caravan composition (wagon limits, documents, provisions)
  - Travel context shared between map and planner screens

- **scripts/events/**: Event & narrative systems
  - EU4-style road event cards: `GameEvent` → `EventChoice` → `EventOutcome`
  - `EventCondition` (triggers) and `EventWeightModifier` (MTTH-style weighting)
  - `EventEffect` is the *only* vocabulary an event may use to touch the world;
    `EventEffectApplier` applies it and enforces the never-total-loss clamps
  - `EventEngine`: eligibility filter, weighted draw, once/cooldown tracking,
    seedable RNG for reproducible runs

### Event Engine Rules

- Road events only. City interaction is deliberately **not** card-based.
- A caravan can be ruined but never wiped out: the player's own wagon is never
  lost, gold never goes negative, provisions never go below zero. These clamps
  live in `EventEffectApplier`/`CaravanState`, never in individual events.
- Locked choices are shown disabled *with their reason*, not hidden, so the
  player learns what to prepare for next time.
- All player-facing event text lives in `data/locale/wayborne_text.csv` as
  translation keys; scripts call `tr(key)`. Never hardcode event prose.
- New effects must be added to the `EventEffect.Type` enum **and** handled in
  `EventEffectApplier`, otherwise they silently do nothing.

- **scripts/character/**: Who the people in the caravan are
  - `CharacterStats`: the six base stats (Güç/Çeviklik/Dayanıklılık/Zeka/
    Sezgi/Karizma) plus every derived value (max HP, initiative, accuracy,
    dodge, crit, damage bonus). Derived formulas live **only** here - the
    character screen and the combat engine both read them from this class.
    Stats run 1-15 but only the first 10 points count at full value -
    `get_effective_value()` returns `min(stat,10)-5 + 0.5*max(0,stat-10)`,
    zero at the starting value of 5. Every derived formula is written as
    `baseline + coefficient * effective_value(stat)`, so a fresh character
    (all stats at 5) behaves exactly as before this system existed; only
    pushing a stat past 10 (via level-ups) triggers the slowdown, on purpose
    - a maxed stat should never dominate the game.
  - `Culture` / `CultureCatalog`: the five cultures (göçebe, vadi loncaları,
    dağ kabilesi, liman şehri, balıkçı kasabası). Each carries a stat lean, a
    name pool and exactly **one** mechanical perk, and every perk plugs into
    a system that already exists (daily provisions, provision price, market
    buy price, combat damage, rumor price). No perk may invent a new system.
  - `CharacterClass` / `ClassCatalog`: combat role. `class_name` is a
    reserved word, so the visible name lives in `display_name`. Four classes
    (Sıra Neferi/Sekban/Kırıkçı/Kalem Efendisi), each with a `stat_affinity`
    (used by auto-allocate) and a `duty_id` - its "ana" kervan görevi, which
    `DutyCatalog.get_duty_power()` rewards when a character actually holds
    that duty.
  - `Duty` / `DutyCatalog`: the six road/city jobs (Muhafız/İzci/Levazımcı/
    Arabacı/Tellal/Otacı), separate from combat class. `GameSession.assign_duty()`
    gives a duty to one party member at a time; `get_duty_multiplier()` /
    `get_duty_discount()` / `get_duty_flat_reduction()` turn that into the
    concrete number a system reads (buy price, repair cost, daily
    consumption, wagon damage, combat opening accuracy, camp stress relief).
    Five of six are wired to a live system - only İzci (travel-day/danger
    reveal, lives in `caravan_planner.gd`/`world_map.gd`) isn't yet. A duty
    with no holder is neutral (multiplier 1.0), never a penalty.
  - `CharacterData`: identity + appearance (boy/ten rengi) + stats + class +
    current HP + level/XP/yetkinlik/second_class_id/duty_id, with
    `to_dict()`/`from_dict()`. Height is not flavour: tall means more HP and
    less dodge, short the reverse. `gain_xp()` levels up (curve: see
    `xp_required_for_level`), granting 1 stat point + 2 yetkinlik points per
    level; `auto_allocate` (default on, companions keep it on, the player can
    turn it off) spends those immediately toward the class's `stat_affinity`
    and its own skills. Multiclass (`set_second_class`) unlocks at
    `MULTICLASS_UNLOCK_LEVEL` (7) and merges both classes' skill lists.
  - `RecruitCatalog`: per-venue candidate pools (meydan cheap/green, taverna
    balanced, lonca expensive and reputation-gated). Candidates are rolled
    **once per city arrival** from a `location + day` seed, so reopening the
    screen cannot reroll them. Each candidate also gets a random class and a
    level scaled off the player's own (`get_venue_level_spread` - meydan
    always below the player, lonca always at or above), granted as real XP
    so `auto_allocate` spends it the same way a levelling companion would.
  - `Trait` / `TraitCatalog`: twelve Darkest-Dungeon-style huy, one virtue
    and one affliction per stat, each a small permanent modifier
    (`hp_bonus`/`dodge_bonus`/`accuracy_bonus`/`crit_bonus`/`damage_bonus`)
    read by `CharacterData.get_max_hp()/get_dodge()/get_accuracy()/
    get_crit_chance()/get_damage_bonus()` alongside the class/height bonus -
    **combat must read these `CharacterData` wrappers, never
    `character.stats.get_X()` directly**, or trait bonuses silently don't
    apply (bkz. `CombatUnit.from_character`). A character carries at most
    `CharacterData.MAX_TRAITS` (3). Seed traits are rolled by
    `TraitCatalog.roll_seed_trait(stats, rng)` - weighted by how far each
    stat sits from baseline, so a lopsided character leans toward matching
    huy without a hard guarantee - and granted explicitly by the two real
    creation flows (`character_creation.gd`, `RecruitCatalog`) with their
    own seeded RNG; `CharacterData.create()` itself never rolls one, so
    every existing test that calls `create()` stays deterministic. Later
    huys come from `EventEffect.Type.GRANT_TRAIT` (always targets the
    player character - bkz. `evt_troubled_night`). Only a "taze" huy -
    granted within `CharacterData.TRAIT_FRESH_WINDOW_DAYS` (5) days of
    `GameSession.total_days_elapsed` - can be removed, at the Tavern or the
    Church (`PurificationPanel`, shared by both, priced differently).

### Character & Party Rules

- **Crew size ≠ combat party.** Crew (chosen in character creation) drives the
  wagons and sets cargo capacity, up to 12 people / 6 wagons. The combat party
  is the named characters and only they fight. Never conflate the two.
- **Party capacity comes from wagons.** `GameSession.get_party_capacity()` is
  `owned_wagon_count * PEOPLE_PER_WAGON`, capped at `MAX_PARTY_SIZE` (4)
  because the battlefield has four ranks. So buying a wagon at the caravan
  yard also buys a party slot; never gate recruiting on `MAX_PARTY_SIZE`
  directly. Events read `party_slots_free` from the context dict, since
  `EventCondition` can only compare a key against a constant.
- The player starts alone. Companions are recruited in the city (`RecruitPanel`)
  or on the road (`evt_road_wanderer`), and every one of them is drawn walking
  behind the leader in `world_hub.gd` — height and skin tone included, so what
  character creation chose is visible in the world.
- **The player is identified by `CharacterData.is_player`, never by index.**
  Party order is combat rank order, so the player can move to the back; a guard
  that tested `index == 0` let them dismiss themselves, kept a companion
  undismissable, and handed the companion's culture perk to the whole caravan.
  `get_player_character()` and `dismiss()` read the flag.
- Party order **is** combat rank order (1 = front). `party.tscn` is where the
  player reads and reorders it (reachable from the road HUD and the city map).
- Characters heal to full on city arrival (`finish_journey()`); the road is
  where damage accumulates.

- **scripts/combat/**: Darkest Dungeon style turn-based combat
  - `CombatSkill` / `SkillCatalog`: position-gated skills. Every skill carries
    both `usable_positions` (where the user must stand) and `target_positions`
    (what it can reach). Numbers live in the catalog, never in the UI.
  - `EnemyTemplate` / `EnemyCatalog`: enemy stats plus `build_bandit_squad()`,
    which scales the squad with the road's danger **and** with party size, so
    a lone traveller never faces four bandits.
  - `CombatUnit`: one fighter on the field. Wraps a `CharacterData` on the
    player side and writes HP back when the fight ends.
  - `CombatEncounter`: the engine itself - initiative order, accuracy vs
    dodge, crits, cooldowns, enemy AI (weakest reachable target), rank
    repacking when someone falls. UI-independent and directly testable.
  - `CombatPanel` (in `scripts/ui/`): builds itself in code and is embedded
    into the journey screen, so a mid-journey fight never changes scenes
    (bkz. `HagglingPanel` deseni).

### Combat Rules

- Four ranks per side, 1 = front. A skill the current position cannot use is
  shown **disabled with its reason**, never hidden - same rule as event choices.
- Losing a fight is not death: `write_back_party()` stands downed characters
  back up at 1 HP. The caravan can be ruined, never wiped out.
- Combat is entered only through `EventEffect.Type.TRIGGER_COMBAT`, bridged by
  `EventEffectApplier.Result.combat_requests` and applied in `road_journey.gd`
  `_on_combat_finished(victory, xp_awarded)`. The bandit ambush's "fight"
  choice no longer rolls dice - it opens the real panel.
- **Timed stat modifiers are the one sanctioned way a skill reaches beyond
  its own hit.** A `CombatSkill` can carry `modifier_stat` ("accuracy",
  "dodge" or "damage"), `modifier_amount` and `modifier_rounds`; landing the
  skill calls `CombatUnit.apply_modifier()` on the target, and
  `CombatEncounter` ticks every unit's modifiers down by one each time the
  round number advances. `get_effective_accuracy()/_dodge()/_damage_bonus()`
  are what combat resolution actually reads - never the raw fields directly
  once a skill might have buffed/debuffed them. A skill with no damage, no
  heal and a non-enemy target (SELF/ALLY) applies its modifier without an
  accuracy roll - see `CombatSkill.make_buff()`.
- **Yetkinlik (skill proficiency) lives on the character, never on the
  shared `CombatSkill` resource.** `CombatUnit.skill_proficiency` (0-100 per
  skill, invested via `CharacterData.invest_skill_point()`) scales that
  unit's damage/heal by up to +50% and shortens its cooldown - mutating the
  cached `CombatSkill`/`EnemyTemplate` singletons directly would leak across
  every other user of that skill/template, which is why enemy level scaling
  is a `power_scale` multiplier applied only to the freshly-built
  `CombatUnit`, not the `EnemyTemplate` itself.

### Stress Rules

- **Stress (`GameSession.party_stress`) and morale (`CaravanState.morale`)
  are deliberately separate stats.** Morale resets to full at the start of
  every journey (`CaravanState.from_plan`) - it's that journey's mood.
  Stress is party-wide and persistent across journeys; only a city arrival
  (`finish_journey()`, `-CITY_REST_STRESS_RELIEF`) or a road camp
  (`GameSession.make_camp()`, `-CAMP_STRESS_RELIEF`) brings it down. Both are
  shown on `world_hub.gd`'s HUD as `PulseBar`s - a bar that flashes to full
  opacity on change and fades back to idle, so the "ana ekran" reflects both
  without permanently cluttering it.
- **Resistance, not a global threshold, decides who breaks.**
  `CharacterData.get_stress_resistance()` scales with the character's own
  Dayanıklılık; `is_stressed(party_stress)` compares the party's current
  stress against that personal line. A high-resistance character can stay
  composed while a low-resistance one has already broken.
- **Breaking (`GameSession.resolve_stress_breaks`) happens once per city
  arrival**, for every currently-stressed character: mostly (85%) an
  affliction, rarely (15%) the DD-style inverse where hardship forges a
  virtue instead - both go through `TraitCatalog.roll_break_trait()`, which
  is `roll_seed_trait()`'s weighting with the polarity pre-decided. An
  afflicted companion (never the player) may also leave the caravan outright
  - **iterate a copy of the party** when a loop might call `dismiss()`, or
  removal mid-iteration silently skips the next character. `Array.duplicate()`
  doesn't carry its element type statically, so assign it to an explicitly
  typed `Array[CharacterData]` variable first (`resolve_stress_breaks()`
  does this) - otherwise the loop variable degrades to `Variant` and any
  `:=` call on it (`character.grant_trait(...)` here) fails to parse; see
  the `:=` / Variant trap under Autoload rule.
- **A broken character can refuse orders in combat.**
  `CombatUnit.is_stressed` (set from `CharacterData.is_stressed()` when the
  encounter is built) gives `CombatEncounter` a flat chance each time that
  unit's turn comes up to skip it entirely, logged and nothing else - never
  exposed as a choice to the player, unlike a locked skill.
- **`EventEffect.Type.STRESS` is the vocabulary events use to touch it**,
  same rule as every other effect: unhandled means silently inert. The
  `stress` key is available in `GameSession.build_event_context()`, so an
  event's own eligibility can key off it directly (`evt_stress_brawl`)
  instead of needing a bespoke weight modifier.

- **scripts/world/**: Explorable 2D spaces the player physically moves through
  - `world_hub.gd`: side-scrolling road. The caravan leader walks left/right;
    the party then the wagons lerp-follow behind, one body per party member and
    one wagon per `owned_wagon_count`. The city gate and the first wagon are
    interaction spots: walk within `INTERACT_RANGE`, then click them or press E. No physics bodies — plain position arithmetic on a
    single ground line, so it stays cheap on Web export.
  - `city_map.gd`: placeholder city map. City interaction is deliberately
    **not** card-based (see Event Engine Rules): each location button opens its
    own screen (market → economy, guild → haggling, tavern → travel map).
  - `nav.gd`: every scene path lives here, plus `Nav.return_scene` — the screen
    a sub-screen's back button returns to. A spot sets it before changing
    scenes, so the same economy screen returns to the road or to the city
    depending on where it was entered from. `selector_return_scene` is the
    test selector's own back target, kept separate because sub-tests overwrite
    `return_scene` to point back at the selector; `character.gd` (opened only
    from `party.gd`) follows the same pattern by hardcoding its own back
    target to `Nav.PARTY` instead of touching `return_scene` at all, so the
    party screen's own return target (world hub or city map, whoever sent the
    player there) survives the detour. `character_target_index` carries which
    party member the character screen shows.
  - There is no SceneManager autoload: navigation is `change_scene_to_file()`
    plus these static vars.

### World Navigation Rules

- Never hardcode a `res://scenes/...` path in a screen script; use `Nav`.
- A screen's back button goes to `Nav.return_scene`, never to a fixed scene.
- Whoever sends the player somewhere is responsible for setting
  `Nav.return_scene` first.
- A screen whose content can grow past the viewport (market rows, the contract
  board, the party list) puts that content in a `ScrollContainer` and keeps the
  back button **outside** it. Otherwise the back button is pushed off-screen and
  the player is stranded - this actually happened on the market screen.

- **scripts/ui/**: User interface scripts
  - Menu controllers
  - HUD management
  - Popup dialogs

- **scripts/autoload/**: Global singleton scripts (configured in project settings)
  - `GameState` (registered autoload): holds the persistent `GameSession`
  - `GameSession` (plain RefCounted): wallet, inventory, caravan, flags,
    reputation, journey — instantiable in tests without touching the autoload
  - `EventBus` (registered autoload): cross-system signals only
  - `DevPanel` (registered autoload): F1 geliştirici menüsü. `test_selector.tscn`'i
    çalışma anında `load()` ile kurup bir CanvasLayer'a gizli ekler; F1 açıp
    kapatır. `Nav.return_scene`'e dokunmaz, bu yüzden bir hedefe geçince o
    ekranın geri tuşu paneli açtığın yere döner, panele değil.
  - `SaveManager` (registered autoload): `GameSession.to_save_dict()` /
    `load_from_dict()` içeriği bilir, burada yalnızca `user://save.json`
    G/Ç'si var. Yalnızca şehir varışında (`finish_journey()` sonrası)
    çağrılır - sefer/kervan alanları o an her zaman sıfırlanmış olduğu
    için hiç serileştirilmez. `GameSession`'ı `load()` ile kurup normal
    örnek metodu çağırır, hiçbir yerde `class_name` ile anmaz.
  - AudioManager (planned)

**Autoload rule:** never reference a `class_name` inside an autoload script —
not in a type annotation, not in a body. Autoloads are parsed before the global
script class cache is ready, so `var x: GameSession` or `GameSession.new()`
fails with *"Could not find type"* and the autoload silently never instantiates
(the build still reports success — check the CI import log for
`Failed to create an autoload`).

`preload()` does **not** fix this: it resolves at compile time, so the failure
just moves down into the preloaded script's own `class_name` references. Use
runtime `load("res://…")` inside a function and construct lazily on first
access. Leave signal parameters untyped (their types are documentation only in
GDScript) and note the intended type in a comment.

**The `:=` / Variant trap.** Not just `load()` - any expression the static
checker can't type (a `for` loop over a plain `Array` returned by
`Array.duplicate()`, a value from `Dictionary.get()`, anything untyped)
makes `:=` fail to parse with `Cannot infer the type of "x" variable`. This
has broken a shipped-green build repeatedly (`city_map.gd`, `run_tests.gd`,
`simulate_journeys.gd`, `resolve_stress_breaks()`) because Godot's own
parser still prints `SCRIPT ERROR` and exits 0 - only the CI log grep
catches it. Fix by giving the *source* value an explicit type before the
loop/assignment (`var typed: Array[CharacterData] = untyped_result`), not by
chasing every downstream `:=` that happens to fail.

## Coding Standards

### GDScript Style Guide

#### Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PlayerController`, `EnemySpawner`)
- **Functions**: `snake_case` (e.g., `take_damage()`, `calculate_loot()`)
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`, `SPAWN_RATE`)
- **Variables**: `snake_case` (e.g., `player_health`, `current_scene`)
- **Private members**: Prefix with `_` (e.g., `_internal_state`, `_update_visuals()`)

#### Class Structure
```gdscript
extends Node

# Constants at top
const DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER = 1.5
const MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3

# Properties/variables
var health: int = 100
var _is_alive: bool = true
var _animation_speed: float = 1.0

# Exported variables for editor
@export var base_damage: float = 10.0
@export var attack_range: float = 50.0

# Signals
signal health_changed(new_health)
signal died

func _ready() -> void:
	pass

func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	pass

# Public methods
func take_damage(amount: int) -> void:
	pass

# Private methods (leading underscore)
func _update_visuals() -> void:
	pass
```

#### Type Hints
- Always use type hints for clarity
- ✅ `func calculate_damage(base: float) -> float:`
- ❌ `func calculate_damage(base):`

#### Comments
- Only comment the "why", not the "what"
- Self-documenting code is preferred
- Avoid redundant comments

```gdscript
# ✅ Good - explains intent
func apply_knockback(direction: Vector2) -> void:
	# Knockback scales with impact force to feel more dynamic
	velocity = direction * impact_force * 2.0

# ❌ Avoid - restates code
func apply_knockback(direction: Vector2) -> void:
	# Set velocity to direction times impact force times 2
	velocity = direction * impact_force * 2.0
```

### Project Best Practices

#### Scene Management
- Keep scenes focused and modular
- Use inheritance for shared behavior
- Prefer composition over deep hierarchies

#### Script Organization
- One public class per file (match filename to class name)
- Keep functions < 30 lines
- Extract complex logic into helper functions

#### Signal Usage
- Define signals at script top after constants
- Use descriptive signal names: `health_changed`, `item_picked_up`
- Emit signals for state changes only

#### Resource Loading
- Use `preload()` for scenes/resources known at edit time
- Use `load()` for dynamic runtime loading
- Cache loaded resources when reused

```gdscript
# ✅ Preload at top
var enemy_scene = preload("res://scenes/enemy.tscn")

# ❌ Load every time
var enemy_scene = load("res://scenes/enemy.tscn")
```

#### Error Handling
- Check for null returns: `assert(resource != null, "Missing resource")`
- Validate input parameters
- Log meaningful error messages

```gdscript
func load_enemy_data(enemy_id: int) -> Dictionary:
	var data = _load_json("res://data/enemies.json")
	assert(data != null, "Failed to load enemy data")
	assert(enemy_id in data, "Unknown enemy: %d" % enemy_id)
	return data[enemy_id]
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Avoid dynamic typing** - Use type hints for better performance
2. **Cache references** - Store frequently accessed nodes/resources
3. **Use object pooling** - Reuse bullets, enemies, effects instead of creating/destroying
4. **Optimize physics** - Use AABB checks before expensive collision tests
5. **Profile before optimizing** - Use Godot's profiler to identify bottlenecks

### Testing

Tests run headless with no addon - a plain GDScript `SceneTree` runner:

```bash
godot --headless --script res://tests/run_tests.gd      # exit 1 on failure
godot --headless --script res://tests/simulate_journeys.gd   # balance report
```

- **No `class_name` in `tests/`.** Test scripts would otherwise land in the
  global class cache and ship with the game. `run_tests.gd` reaches suites with
  runtime `load()` for the same reason it avoids `class_name` itself: the
  autoload parse-order trap.
- A suite is a `RefCounted` script with `suite_name() -> String` and
  `run(t) -> void`; `t` is `tests/test_reporter.gd`. Register it in
  `run_tests.gd`'s `SUITE_PATHS`.
- Test the UI-free cores, which is why they were written UI-free:
  `CharacterStats`, `CombatEncounter`, `EventEngine`, `EventEffectApplier`,
  `GameSession`. Never test engine internals or scene wiring.
- `test_progression.gd` locks the XP curve, diminishing-returns stat math,
  auto-allocate and the multiclass unlock; `test_duties.gd` locks
  `DutyCatalog.get_duty_power()`'s class-match multipliers and the discount/
  flat-reduction formulas `GameSession` derives from it; `test_save_migration.gd`
  loads a save dict shaped like it predates a given field and asserts sane
  defaults - a reminder that every new `CharacterData`/`GameSession` field
  needs a `.get(key, default)` in `from_dict()`/`load_from_dict()`, never a
  bare index; `test_recruit_catalog.gd` locks the per-venue level spread and
  that granted levels actually get auto-spent; `test_traits.gd` locks the
  catalog shape, the fresh-window boundary and that `CharacterData`'s
  derived getters actually include trait bonuses - a statistically
  overwhelming-margin check (not an exact roll) on `roll_seed_trait`'s lean,
  same reasoning as `test_event_engine.gd`'s seed-reproducibility test;
  `test_stress.gd` locks stress clamping, resistance-scales-with-Dayanıklılık,
  `resolve_stress_breaks()` (polarity, the player never departing, calm
  parties never breaking), `make_camp()`, the `STRESS` effect, and - same
  overwhelming-margin pattern again - that a stressed `CombatUnit` sometimes
  refuses orders while a calm one deterministically never does.
- Seed every RNG. A test that can flake is worse than no test.
- `simulate_journeys.gd` is **not** a test - it never fails, it prints a
  distribution (net payout, morale, starvation rate, combat win rate by party
  size). It is the only honest way to tune balance without playing.

**CI is the real gate.** Godot prints parse errors and still exits `0`, so a
broken script hid under a green build twice (`city_map.gd`,
`ClassCatalog.get_class`). `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` now tees every Godot
invocation to a log and fails the job on `SCRIPT ERROR`, `Parse Error`,
`Compile Error`, `Failed to load script` or `Failed to create an autoload`.
Never remove that step to make a build pass.

## CI/CD & Deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions to automatically export and deploy the game:

- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **Actions**:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup Godot 4.2.2
  3. Import Godot project
  4. Export to HTML5 (Web)
  5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

### GitHub Pages Setup

To enable GitHub Pages deployment:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to `GitHub Actions`
3. Workflow will automatically deploy on each `main` push

### Export Presets

Web export is configured in `export_presets.cfg`:
- Platform: HTML5/Web
- Output: `build/web/index.html`
- Features: WASM, streaming enabled, threading disabled

### Cross-Origin Isolation (GitHub Pages)

Godot's Web export requires `crossOriginIsolated`/`SharedArrayBuffer`
unconditionally (this check is baked into the export template itself,
regardless of the `web/enable_threading` setting). GitHub Pages cannot
send the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` / `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`
headers this needs, since it's static hosting with no custom header
support.

The deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) works around this by
copying `web/coi-serviceworker.js` into the export output and injecting a
`<script>` tag into `index.html`'s `<head>` after export. This service
worker intercepts same-origin fetches and injects the required headers
client-side, then triggers one page reload so the isolated context takes
effect. Do not remove this step unless GitHub Pages gains custom header
support or the game is hosted somewhere that can send these headers
directly.

### Local Testing

To export locally:
```bash
godot --headless --export-release Web build/web/index.html
```

Then serve with:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000 -d build/web
```

## Development Status

Faz 0-3 tamamlandı. Oyun bir tur dönüyor (kazanç ödeniyor, harita tam
bağlı, fiyat şehre göre değişiyor, kargo kapasitesi var), test iskelesi
oyuna çevrildi (`scenes/game/`, F1 dev paneli), ilerleme kalıcı
(`SaveManager`), şehrin dört lokasyonu artık gerçek ekranlar - kart
tabanlı değil, her biri kendi kararını taşıyor:

- **Pazar Meydanı** (`market.gd`): şehir başına stok sınırı
  (`Location.stock_per_item` / `GameSession.market_stock`, her varışta
  dolar), miktar seçili toptan alım, `HagglingPanel` üzerinden bulk
  pazarlık.
- **Tüccar Loncası** (`guild.gd`): kontrat panosu. Teklifler artık
  statik veri değil, `GameSession.accepted_contracts`'ta tutulan
  oturum durumu - kabul edilince panodan kalkar, sefere çıkılmadan
  süresi geçerse (`MerchantOffer.contract_deadline_days`, `advance_day()`)
  ya da yolda teslim edilemezse (`CaravanState.original_merchant_names`,
  `finish_journey()`) itibar cezası uygulanır. Büyük kontratlar itibar
  ister (`required_reputation`).
- **Taverna** (`tavern.gd`): rota dedikodusu. `GameSession.known_routes`
  öğrenilmedikçe dünya haritası tehlikeyi yalnızca kaba bir bant
  (düşük/orta/yüksek) gösterir, tam yüzde parayla öğrenilir.
- **Kervan Avlusu** (`caravan_yard.gd`): vagon onarımı ve alımı.
  Oyuncu artık kalıcı olarak vagon sahibi (`GameSession.owned_wagon_count`
  / `owned_wagon_damaged`, karakter oluşturmada tayfa sayısından
  hesaplanır);
  sefer sırasındaki kayıp/hasar escort vagonlarına öncelikli uygulanıp
  varışta sahipliğe taşınır (bkz. `_apply_wagon_losses_to_ownership`).

Faz 4 (karakter + combat) tamamlandı. Oyuna artık bir "sen" girdi:

- **Karakter oluşturma** (`character_creation.gd`, `Nav.CHARACTER_CREATION`):
  kültür, isim (kültür havuzundan rastgele ya da elle), boy, ten rengi,
  6 stata dağıtılan puan ve tayfa büyüklüğü. Ana menüdeki "Yeni Oyun"
  artık doğrudan oyunu başlatmıyor, buraya getiriyor; kayıt yalnızca
  bu ekran tamamlanınca siliniyor.
- **Combat** (`scripts/combat/`, `CombatPanel`): Darkest Dungeon tarzı,
  4 mevkilik iki saf, inisiyatif sırası, mevki kilitli yetenekler.
  Haydut pususunun "Direnç göster" seçeneği artık zar atmıyor, gerçek
  savaşı açıyor (`TRIGGER_COMBAT`). F1 panelindeki "combat" girişi de
  bağlandı (`scenes/game/combat.tscn`).
- **Tayfa toplama** (`RecruitCatalog`, `RecruitPanel`, `recruit.gd`):
  meydan/taverna/lonca aynı ekranı farklı havuz ve fiyatla açar
  (`Nav.recruit_venue`), lonca itibar ister. Yolda da bir aday çıkabilir
  (`evt_road_wanderer` → `TRIGGER_RECRUIT`).

Faz 5 (güvenlik ağı) tamamlandı: CI artık her push/PR'da testleri koşturup
Godot'un sessizce geçtiği ayrıştırma hatalarını yakalıyor (`tests.yml`),
314 doğrulamalık yedi paket ve `simulate_journeys.gd` denge simülatörü var.

Faz 6 ("Karakterin Yolculuğu") tamamlandı - dört PR'lık bir hat:

- **PR-A (veri katmanı)** stat tavanını 15'e çıkardı ve 10 üstünü
  yavaşlattı (`CharacterStats.get_effective_value`), XP/seviye eğrisini,
  dört sınıfı (Sıra Neferi/Sekban/Kırıkçı/Kalem Efendisi) ve on iki yeni
  yeteneği, süreli stat değiştiricileri (`CombatSkill.modifier_*`),
  yetkinlik (per-skill continuous investment) ve altı kervan görevini
  (`Duty`/`DutyCatalog`) getirdi - dördü (Muhafız/Levazımcı/Arabacı/Tellal)
  canlı sistemlere bağlandı, Otacı PR-D'nin kamp/stres sistemine bağlandı;
  İzci hâlâ katalogda hazır ama bağlanmadı (ev sistemi
  `caravan_planner.gd`/`world_map.gd`, henüz okunmadı).
- **PR-B (karakter ekranı)** bu veri katmanını ilk kez oynanabilir kıldı:
  yeni `Nav.CHARACTER` ekranı (stat/yetkinlik yatırımı, görev ataması,
  multiclass, Faz 7'ye kilitli ekipman yer tutucuları), karakter
  oluşturmada sınıf seçimi, seviyeli/sınıflı tayfa adayları.
- **PR-C (huylar + Kilise)** on iki huy (`Trait`/`TraitCatalog`, her stat
  için bir olumlu bir olumsuz), karakter kurulurken statlarla orantılı
  ağırlıklı seed huy (`roll_seed_trait`), `EventEffect.Type.GRANT_TRAIT`
  (ilk kullanımı `evt_troubled_night`) ve yalnızca beş gün içinde
  kazanılmış ("taze") huyları silen `PurificationPanel`'i getirdi -
  Taverna'da pahalı, yeni Kilise'de (`Nav.CHURCH`) ucuz.
- **PR-D (stres/moral döngüsü + kamp)** `GameSession.party_stress`'i
  (bkz. Stress Rules) getirdi: dayanıklılığa göre kişisel kırılma direnci,
  şehir varışında toplu kırılma zarı (`resolve_stress_breaks` - çoğunlukla
  huy, nadiren tam tersi, ağır kırılan bir yoldaş kervandan ayrılabilir),
  savaşta emir reddi (`CombatUnit.is_stressed`), yolda yeni bir "Kamp Kur"
  eylemi (`GameSession.make_camp`) ve yüksek stresin kendi olayını
  (`evt_stress_brawl`) açması. `world_hub.gd`'nin HUD'una moral ve stresi
  gösteren iki `PulseBar` eklendi.

Sırada Faz 7: ekipman (karakter ekranındaki dört yer tutucu slotun
gerçek eşyalarla dolması), İzci'nin gerçek sisteme bağlanması, olay
havuzunun genişlemesi (şu an 13 olay), placeholder isimlerin gerçek
lore'a dönüşmesi.

## Quick Start

1. Open `project.godot` in Godot 4.2+
2. Create your first scene in `scenes/main.tscn`
3. Create scripts in appropriate `scripts/` subfolders
4. Reference scenes/scripts using `res://` paths
5. Push to `main` branch to trigger automatic Web export & deployment
